### What are penal codes?

Penal codes can easily be referenced and cited in records/reports as charges.

### 1. Charge Types

You can create your own "Charge Type" options for penal codes. If your country does not have "felonies" you can edit or remove this option.

You can also use the "Auto Sort" feature to quickly format the order of these charge types.

Be sure to hit "Save" before exiting the page.

### 2. Bond Types

You can create your own "Bond'/Bail Type" options for penal codes. Again, if your country does not use these, you can edit or remove them as needed.

You can also use the "Auto Sort" feature to quickly format the order of these charge types.
