## What are custom records and reports?

Sonoran CAD allows your community to create custom records and incident reports for police, fire, and EMS services. This tutorial will cover the basics of creating a new custom report or record and general usage of the system.

## Creating a new Report or Record:

### 1. Navigate to the Record Editor

Navigate to Admin &gt; Customization &gt; Custom Records

### 2. Select the new Record Type

From the "New Record Type" dropdown, select the desired record type.  
  
Records follow the standard record editing and lookup system, and require a civilian or vehicle field to be searched.  
  
Reports can be searched in the unit's report center via number or identifier.

### 3. Add Custom and Pre-made Sections

## 

Add your desired custom and premade sections, edit fields, and more!

Fields can be an input, select, or text area.

#### 2. Supervisor

This will disable the field for all non-supervisor unit identifiers.  
Your unit's supervisor status can be set in the unit identifier editor.

#### 3. Required

Required fields will require the unit to enter something into the field before the record can be submitted.

![Input field with REQUIRED toggled](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2822%29.png)

![Required field shown in the record editor](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%286%29.png)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Field Size" %}
The field size slider allows you to select a field size value between 1 and 12.

Every row of a record has a space divisible by 12.

## Using your new Record Type

In the police, dispatch, fire, or EMS page you can now [add ](../records-management/adding-a-criminal-record.md)or [search ](../records-management/searching-for-records.md)for the new record type.

## Using your New Report

### 1. Accessing the Reports Center

In the police, dispatch, fire, or EMS page, select "REPORTS" in the top action menu bar  
From here, you can create a new report, search existing reports, and view reports requiring supervisor actions.  


![Sonoran CAD Reports Center](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%289%29.png)

### 2. Creating a New Report

Select "New Report" and the desired custom report type from the dropdown button  
From there, you can fill out the fields and add the record.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the "NEW REPORT" button, or actions on the report viewer are disabled, you are missing the [permissions ](../getting-started/permissions.md)to do so.
{% endhint %}

### 3. Supervisor Panel

The supervisor panel shows all reports that have a blank field that requires supervisor permissions.  
If you do not have the supervisor panel enabled, you will need to have the supervisor toggle enabled in your unit identifier.
