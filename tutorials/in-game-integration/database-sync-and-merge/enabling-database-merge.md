## What is Database Merge?

By design, [Database Sync](configuring-database-sync.md) is a read-only system. Database Sync automatically pulls all of your in-game characters, licenses, and vehicle registrations directly into the CAD.  
  
Because these records are provided from your own in-game database, these records are "read-only" and can not be modified in the CAD.  
  
Database Merge allows you to manually edit and specify additional fields in a character, license, or vehicle registration that are not provided by your in-game database.  
  
When you search for a character, license, or vehicle registration from your in-game database, Database Merge will pull in any additionally saved information you have specified in the CAD and "merge" it with the data provided from your in-game database.
