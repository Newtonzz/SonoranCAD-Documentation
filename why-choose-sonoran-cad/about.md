### Custom Branding

Sonoran CAD enables you to place your community's name and [branding](../tutorials/customization/community-branding-and-info.md) in the CAD, [customize user account emails](../tutorials/customization/custom-emails.md), host a [custom login page](../tutorials/customization/custom-login-page.md) on **your own domain**, and more!

### Multitasking Window and Tab System

Only Sonoran CAD lets you easily multitask and open multiple search windows, records, penal codes references, ten code lists, and more! Our workflow allows you to handle even the most complicated and demanding patrols.

### Self-Dispatch

Don't have a dedicated dispatcher for your community?  
Sonoran CAD allows your units to easily [self-dispatch](../tutorials/dispatching/self-dispatch.md), attach to calls, preview other open calls, and more!
